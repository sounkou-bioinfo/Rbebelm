//! End-to-end generation tests against the real Q4_K_M weights.
//!
//! These load the full ~5.2 GB GGUF and run real generation, so they are gated behind
//! `#[ignore]`: the default `cargo test` stays fast and needs no model file. Run them
//! explicitly once the weights are present:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --release -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! The weights path comes from `$BEBELM_WEIGHTS_FILE`, defaulting to the GGUF in the repo
//! root (same resolution as the CLI). Assertions check robust signals (a known substring, the
//! presence of source data, structural characters) rather than exact token ids, which can
//! drift across builds and architectures.
