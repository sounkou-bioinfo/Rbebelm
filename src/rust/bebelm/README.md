# BebeLM

Pure-Rust, CPU-only implementation of [LFM2.5-8B-A1B Q4_K_M](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/lfm2-5-8b-a1b).
This model is very capable and has only 1B active parameters, making it possible for the
model to run at interactive speeds without a GPU.

This package intentionally has very few dependencies and requires no extra system
packages to compile, making it easy to build and run.
This is a library crate which can be imported into your Rust projects, and it's now available
via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bebelm). There is also a basic command-line
interface that you can use.

The model needs about ~6-8GB of RAM to run (depending on context length).
BebeLM was tested on an M5 CPU as well as Ryzen 7x and Threadripper CPUs. It should work
on Intel and on Raspberry Pi 4/5 as well, but this is untested.

## Setup instructions

Install cargo or update your rust toolchain:
```sh
# Install Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Update Rust toolchain
rustup update
```

Running also requires downloading the ~5.2 GB Q4_K_M model weights:

```sh
curl -L -o LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  "https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-8B-A1B-GGUF/resolve/main/LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf"
```

The CLI reads the weights path from `BEBELM_WEIGHTS_FILE`, defaulting to
`./LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf` (the current directory). Point it elsewhere with:

```sh
export BEBELM_WEIGHTS_FILE=/path/to/LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

### Installing via cargo

Install the CLI from crates.io — this puts a `bebelm` binary on your `PATH`:

```sh
cargo install bebelm
```

### Development setup

Clone the repo and build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maximecb/bebelm
cd bebelm
cargo build --release
```

## Command-line interface

Build with `cargo build --release`, then run a subcommand on `./target/release/bebelm` (the
examples below use `cargo run --release --` for convenience). Every subcommand loads the
weights from `BEBELM_WEIGHTS_FILE` (see above).

- **`generate [options] <prompt>…`** — one-shot text completion of a prompt; streams tokens as
  they are produced and reports prefill/decode throughput.
- **`chat [options]`** — interactive multi-turn chat. Streams the model's full output, showing
  the `<think>...</think>` reasoning and the final answer in different colors. The KV / conv
  caches persist across turns, so each message only prefills its own new tokens. `Ctrl-D` or
  `/exit` to quit.
- **`ask [options] <question>…`** — one-shot single-turn chat. Encodes the question as a user
  turn, streams the model's reply (including reasoning), and exits.

All commands take the same options (sampling defaults to the model's recommended settings):

- `--greedy` — deterministic greedy decoding instead of sampling.
- `--max-gen N` — cap tokens generated per turn (default 2048); counts every generated token,
  reasoning included, so a long `<think>` block eats into the budget left for the answer.
- `--max-think N` — cap the `<think>` reasoning block to N tokens (forces `</think>`).
- `--no-think` — disable reasoning (equivalent to `--max-think 0`).
- `--hide-think` — generate reasoning but hide it from the output (streams only the answer).
- `--num-threads N` — cap the rayon worker pool (default: one per available core).

```sh
# Interactive chat
cargo run --release -- chat

# One-shot single-turn chat
cargo run --release -- ask "How do I implement binary search in Rust?"

# One-shot completion
cargo run --release -- generate --max-gen 64 "The capital of France is"
```

## Public crate API

`bebelm` is a library first; the CLI is a thin wrapper over it. The high-level entry point is
`bebelm::agent::Agent` — a conversation bound to a loaded model that owns the token transcript
and the decode-time caches.

Load the model once, then back one or more agents with it:

```rust
use bebelm::agent::Agent;
use bebelm::model::Model;

// mmaps + validates the GGUF.
let model = Model::load("LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf")?;

// An agent borrows the model — the ~5.2 GB of weights are shared, so several agents are cheap.
let mut agent = Agent::new(&model);

agent.append_user("What is the capital of France?");
let turn = agent.assistant_turn(|_, _| {});   // generate the whole reply at once
println!("{}", turn.text);

// Keep chatting — the KV/conv caches persist, so only the new tokens are prefilled.
agent.append_user("And of Italy?");
let turn = agent.assistant_turn(|_, _| {});
println!("{}", turn.text);
```

Here `|_, _| {}` is a do-nothing token callback, so the whole reply is just collected into
`turn.text`. To instead stream tokens as they are generated, pass a real callback — see
**Generating** below.

**Configuration** — builder methods chained after `Agent::new(..)` (sampling defaults to the
model's recommended temperature 0.2 / top-k 80 / repeat-penalty 1.05):

- `.greedy()` — deterministic argmax decoding.
- `.temperature(f32)` / `.top_k(usize)` / `.repeat_penalty(f32)` — individual sampler knobs.
- `.max_gen(usize)` — tokens generated per turn (default 2048); counts reasoning tokens too, so
  the `<think>` block and the answer share this budget.
- `.max_context(usize)` — KV attention-window cap in tokens (default 32768); older context
  slides out rather than stopping generation.
- `.max_think(usize)` — cap the `<think>` reasoning block (`0` ⇒ no reasoning block at all).

**Building the prompt** — these only grow the transcript; nothing runs until you generate:

- `append_user(&str)` — wrap a ChatML user turn (`<|im_start|>user\n…<|im_end|>\n`).
- `append(&str)` — append raw text (BOS is added automatically on the first append).
- `append_tokens(&[u32])` — append already-tokenized ids (e.g. a tool result).

**Generating** — `assistant_turn` and `generate` both return a `Turn` and take an `on_token`
callback:

- `assistant_turn(on_token)` — open an assistant turn (ChatML), stream the reply, and close the
  turn; pair it with `append_user` (as above).
- `generate(on_token)` — the lower-level primitive: prefill pending tokens, then decode a raw
  continuation (no ChatML framing) until EOS or `max_gen`; pair it with `append` for plain text
  completion:

```rust
let mut agent = Agent::new(&model);
agent.append("The capital of France is");
let turn = agent.generate(|_, _| {});      // raw continuation; turn.text = " the city of Paris…"
println!("The capital of France is{}", turn.text);
```

The returned `Turn`:

```rust
pub struct Turn {
    pub ids: Vec<u32>,    // generated ids (excludes the prompt and the terminating EOS)
    pub text: String,     // the decoded reply
    pub stats: GenStats,  // prompt_tokens, generated_tokens, prefill/decode Durations + *_tps()
    pub stop: StopReason, // Eos, MaxNew, or ToolCall
}
```

The `on_token` callback is `impl FnMut(u32, &str)`, called once per visible token as it is
decoded — its arguments are `(id, text)`:

- `id: u32` — the token id; compare it against the `bebelm::tokenizer` constants below for
  control-token logic (e.g. spotting `<think>` / `</think>` to colour the reasoning).
- `text: &str` — that same token decoded to a string, ready to print.

The terminating EOS is not passed to the callback, and the full reply is in `turn.text` either
way. To stream tokens as they are produced:

```rust
use bebelm::tokenizer;

agent.append_user("Explain RoPE briefly.");
agent.assistant_turn(|id, text| {
    if id == tokenizer::TOKEN_THINK_END {
        println!();  // the <think> reasoning block just ended
    }
    print!("{text}");
});
```

`agent.clear()` resets the conversation (keeping the weights); `agent.history()` returns the
full token transcript.

**Prefilling** — `agent.prefill()` runs the model over the appended-but-unprocessed prompt to
warm the KV/conv caches *without* decoding. `generate` prefills lazily anyway, so this is purely
an optimization for the fork-many pattern below: warm a shared prefix once, then `clone` it.
Prefilling never changes what the model produces.

**Cloning** — `Agent` implements `Clone`, so a shared prefix (e.g. a system prompt plus a few
example turns) can be built and prefilled once, then cheaply forked into several independent
continuations — each clone keeps its own transcript and KV/conv caches, and generating on one
doesn't affect the others:

```rust
let mut base = Agent::new(&model).greedy();
base.append_system("You are a terse assistant. Answer in one word where possible.");
base.prefill();   // warm the shared prefix into the caches once, without generating

let mut a = base.clone();
let mut b = base.clone();
a.append_user("What is the capital of France?");
b.append_user("What is the capital of Italy?");
println!("{}", a.assistant_turn(|_, _| {}).text);
println!("{}", b.assistant_turn(|_, _| {}).text);
```

**Tool use (function calling)** — register tools with `add_tool`, advertise them in the system
block with `append_system`, then let `assistant_turn_with_tools` run the loop: it generates,
dispatches each tool the model calls, feeds the results back as a `tool`-role message, and
repeats until the model produces a plain-text answer (bounded by `max_rounds` assistant turns).
Tool schemas and parsed arguments are plain strings — no `serde` dependency.

```rust
use bebelm::agent::Agent;
use bebelm::model::Model;
use bebelm::tool::{Schema, Tool, Type};

let model = Model::load("LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M.gguf")?;

// Register tools before the system block. `Tool` is `Clone`, so `Agent` stays `Clone`.
let mut agent = Agent::new(&model).add_tool(Tool::new(
    "add",
    "Add two integers.",
    Schema::new()
        .req("a", Type::Int, "First addend")
        .req("b", Type::Int, "Second addend"),
    |call| {
        // Args arrive as raw text; `parse_arg` parses one into the receiver's type (`arg`
        // gives the raw &str). Both return `Option`, so the callback picks the fallback here.
        let a: i64 = call.parse_arg("a").unwrap_or(0);
        let b: i64 = call.parse_arg("b").unwrap_or(0);
        (a + b).to_string()
    },
));

agent.append_system("You are a helpful assistant.");
agent.append_user("What is 21 + 21?");

// Run the agentic loop: stream the reply, and observe each tool call + result.
let turn = agent.assistant_turn_with_tools(
    8,                                            // max assistant turns
    |_id, text| print!("{text}"),
    |call, result| eprintln!("[tool] {} -> {result}", call.name),
);
println!("\n{}", turn.text);
```

`Schema::req` / `Schema::opt` declare required / optional parameters (`Type` is `Str`, `Int`,
`Num`, or `Bool`); `Tool::raw` is an escape hatch that takes the entire tool JSON verbatim. An
unknown tool name is reported back to the model rather than aborting the loop.

**Special tokens** live in `bebelm::tokenizer` as `u32` constants. The agent handles BOS, EOS,
and the ChatML / `<think>` framing for you — these are mostly for interpreting the `id` your
`on_token` callback receives:

- `TOKEN_BOS` — `<|startoftext|>`, start-of-sequence (auto-prepended on the first `append`).
- `TOKEN_IM_START` / `TOKEN_IM_END` — `<|im_start|>` / `<|im_end|>`, ChatML turn delimiters.
- `TOKEN_EOS` — alias of `TOKEN_IM_END`; ends a turn.
- `TOKEN_THINK` / `TOKEN_THINK_END` — `<think>` / `</think>`, reasoning-block delimiters.
- `TOKEN_ENDOFTEXT` / `TOKEN_PAD` — `<|endoftext|>` / `<|pad|>`, document/pad markers.
- `TOKEN_TOOL_LIST_START` / `TOKEN_TOOL_LIST_END` / `TOKEN_TOOL_CALL_START` / `TOKEN_TOOL_CALL_END`
  — `<|tool_*|>` delimiters.
- `TOKEN_FIM_PRE` / `TOKEN_FIM_MID` / `TOKEN_FIM_SUF` — `<|fim_*|>` fill-in-the-middle markers.

For lower-level use, `Model::forward_step(token, &mut Cache)` runs the cached forward pass
directly, and `bebelm::tokenizer::Tokenizer` (`encode` / `decode`) and `bebelm::sampler::Sampler`
are public if you want to drive decoding yourself.

## CPU / SIMD build

The x86 SIMD kernels are tuned for the machine you build on: `.cargo/config.toml` sets
`target-cpu=native`, so a build automatically uses **AVX2 + FMA** when the CPU has them
and falls back to whatever it supports otherwise.

Because `native` targets the build host, a binary built on an AVX2 machine may fault on an
older CPU. To build a portable binary, override the CPU target via `RUSTFLAGS` (it takes
precedence over `.cargo/config.toml`):

```sh
# AVX2 baseline — runs on any Haswell (2013) or newer x86:
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=x86-64-v3" cargo build --release

# Universal baseline — runs on any x86_64 (SSE2 only, slowest):
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=x86-64" cargo build --release
```

The instruction set is chosen at build time; there is no single binary that switches at
runtime.

## Running the tests

The test suite has two layers:

- **Fast unit tests** run with plain `cargo test` — they need no model file and finish in
  seconds, so they are the default and what CI runs first.
- **End-to-end tests** (`tests/end_to_end.rs`) load the full ~5.2 GB Q4_K_M GGUF and run real
  generation against it. They are gated behind `#[ignore]` so `cargo test` stays model-free, and
  they read the weights path from `BEBELM_WEIGHTS_FILE` (defaulting to the repo-root GGUF, same
  resolution as the CLI — see **Setup instructions** for downloading it).

Run the **full** end-to-end suite — every `#[ignore]`d test — with `--ignored`:

```sh
cargo test --release -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

Each test loads the model independently and runs real decoding, so the full suite is slow. For
a quick **partial** run, append a test-name filter (a substring match) — e.g. the single
Paris-completion smoke test, the fastest one:

```sh
# one end-to-end test (fast smoke check)
cargo test --release -- --ignored capital_of_france_is_paris
```

A broader substring targets a group, e.g. `cargo test --release -- --ignored multi_turn`. List
the available end-to-end tests without running them with
`cargo test --release -- --ignored --list`. Always use `--release`: a debug build runs the
numeric kernels far slower.
